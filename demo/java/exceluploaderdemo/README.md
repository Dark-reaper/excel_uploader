Java excel_uploader Demo
=========================

 This is a demo Java web application that uses the excel_uploader.js library for processing bulk data upload via excel.
 
 It's a Spring Boot app and as such can be run by executing the jar file in dist folder. It will run on 
 localhost:9000 by default.
 
 It's configured to **connect to a mysql database server running on localhost at port 3306 and that has a database named
 test and a username root with password root**. If your local mysql does not have such database you can create it for this purpose.
 
 Usage
 =====
 For you to run the application, make sure you have at least Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system.
  CD into the `exceluploaderdemo` dir and execute
 
 ```
 java -jar "dist/excel-uploader-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
 ```
